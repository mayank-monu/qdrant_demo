{"prompt": "What happens to the coverage if my spouse and I divorce?", "completion": " Typically, if your spouse was covered under your health benefit plan, he/she would cease being eligible for coverage through your contract upon the divorce. However, because of a federal law known as COBRA which might apply, your former spouse may be able to retain independent coverage under your employer's coverage for some period of time, provided he or she pays the full amount of their premium.

{"prompt": "What are utilization management, utilization review and medical necessity review?", "completion": " Here's what it all means and how it works.To see if the health care or service your doctor or other health care provider wants to give you is a 201cmedical necessity,201d Anthem looks at requests for authorization. Check your Evidence of Coverage or benefit booklet to know what makes something a 201cmedical necessity201d and when care requires this review.A 201cmedical necessity review201d may be called utilization review (UR), utilization management (UM), or medical management. It is a review process that helps decide if a certain outpatient care, inpatient hospital stay, technology or procedure is medically needed.Reviews can happen at different times including:When a service, treatment or procedure is asked for or planned ahead. We call this prospective or pre-service review.During the course of care. We call this inpatient or outpatient ongoing care review.After care or services have been given. We call this retrospective or post-service review.With so many different things to consider, it may help to get a clear picture of what to expect and how the process works.Timing matters.We2019re committed to deciding cases quickly. Here are types of reviews and time frames you can expect. (The maximum time allowed for a health plan to decide medical necessity once it gets the information needed.)Non-urgent pre-service (before care):5 business days for fully-insured and HMO/POS plans15 calendar days for self-funded plans (unless otherwise stated in your Evidence of Coverage or benefit booklet)72 hours for non-urgent prescription drug requests for fully-insured and HMO/POS plansUrgent pre-service (before care):72 hours24 hours for urgent prescription drug requests for fully-insured and HMO/POS plansUrgent inpatient or outpatient ongoing care (during care):24 hours (in some cases) or no later than within 72 hours of getting a requestRetrospective/post-service (after care):30 calendar daysWhat happens if there is a delay?If we don2019t have the information we need to make a decision, we try to get it from the doctor or other health care provider who requests the service or care.We2019ll write you and the requesting doctor or health care provider if there might be a delay because the information we need is not easy to get. This letter tells you what we need to make a decision. It also explains when to expect the decision once we get the information.If we don2019t get the information we need, we will send a final letter explaining that we are unable to approve access to this benefit because we don2019t have enough information.Professional reviewers decideQualified licensed health care professionals and doctors from Anthem Blue Cross and the medical group (or their peers) review requests and give an opinion specific to a medical condition, procedure and/or treatment under review. If the reviewer is unable to decide the medical necessity of a request, he or she may call the requesting doctor or other provider to discuss the case. In many cases, medical necessity can be determined after this call.Decisions are based on what is right for each member for the type of care and service. Medically necessary review decisions made by Anthem Blue Cross are based on:Anthem2019s medical policy criteria and guidelines (reviewed at least once a year and updated as standards and technology change).Nationally recognized clinical guidelines approved by a committee including practicing doctors and health care professionals not employed by Anthem Blue Cross.Your health benefits.Employees, consultants or other providers are not rewarded or offered money or other incentives for denying care or a service, or for supporting decisions that result in using fewer services. Also, Anthem doesn2019t make decisions about hiring, promoting or firing these individuals based on the idea or thought that they will deny benefits.Medical necessity doesn2019t mean payment or coverageIf we find services are medically necessary, it doesn2019t mean the service is paid for or covered. Payment is based on the terms of your coverage at the time of service. There are some exclusions, limitations and other conditions that are part of your benefits. You will find them in your Evidence of Coverage or benefit booklet.Payment of benefits could be limited for a number of reasons, such as:Information included with the claim differs from that given at time of review.The service performed is not covered.You2019re not eligible for coverage when the service is given.Decisions not to approve are put in writingIf we find the service is not a medical necessity, you and your doctor or health care provider requesting it will be sent written notice within two business days of the decision. This written notice has:A clear and simple explanation of the reason for the decision.The name of the criteria and/or guidelines used to make the decision and instructions for how to get a written copy.Information on how to appeal the decision and about your rights to an independent medical review.Specific parts of the contract that exclude coverage if the denial is based upon benefit coverage.To see our guidelinesAnyone can see our medical necessity guidelines for specific services.View our guidelines here.

{"prompt": "Who's eligible for continuity/transition of care?", "completion": " To help ensure continuity/transition of care, we have in place a Transition Assistance Program for newly-covered members that may allow them, if eligible, to continue to see their treating doctor or health professional even though that provider is not part of their new health plan. This Transition Assistance Program is limited to situations where the member was receiving services for certain medical/behavioral conditions at the time their new coverage became effective. It allows in-network benefits for a defined period of time when the treating provider is not part of the Anthem Blue Cross participating provider network and there are clinical reasons preventing immediate transfer of care to another provider who is a participating provider. In addition, the non-participating provider and Anthem would need to agree on payment terms. Members who had the option to continue with their previous health plan or provider and instead chose to change health plans or providers are not eligible for the Transition Assistance Program.Effective January 1, 2018 we expanded our Transition Assistance Program to include newly-covered members under an Individual health care service plan contract whose prior coverage was terminated when their health benefit plan was withdrawn from the market.Continuity/transition of care may also be provided for members who experience a network disruption with their Primary Medical Group (PMG), Independent Physician Association (IPA), or hospital as a result of a closure or terminated contract with Anthem Blue Cross.
